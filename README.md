Q Agent

Overview:

Q Agent is a lightweight, evolving security tool designed to query systems for vulnerabilities. Inspired by tools like Tenable Nessus, its goal is to provide vulnerability scanning and security assessments across various systems.

Currently, Q Agent is in its early stages and is only compatible with Windows. However, future updates will introduce support for Linux, macOS, and other platforms.
Features (Current & Planned)

âœ… System Vulnerability Scanning â€“ Checks for common security issues in installed software and hardware.
âœ… CPU & Hardware Security Checks â€“ Identifies potential CPU vulnerabilities (e.g., Spectre, Meltdown).
âœ… Software Inventory Analysis â€“ Lists installed software and helps identify outdated or vulnerable versions.
ðŸ›  Planned Enhancements:

    Expanded OS Compatibility â€“ Support for Linux/macOS.
    Advanced CVE Database Integration â€“ Fetch real-time CVE data for security assessments.
    Automated Patch Recommendations â€“ Suggest security patches and updates.
    Network Scanning & Port Auditing â€“ Identify open ports and potential attack surfaces.
    Integration with Security APIs â€“ Enhance results using third-party threat intelligence.
